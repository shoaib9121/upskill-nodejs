# M7 & M8 A1 - No SQL and MongoDB

## Assignment
Building a Blogging Platform with MongoDB

## Description
Your assignment is to build a Blogging Platform using MongoDB as the NoSQL database. The platform should allow users to create blog posts, categorize them, perform aggregations, and implement replication and sharding for scalability.

## MongoDB Setup and Document Creation
Install MongoDB on your local machine or use a cloud-based MongoDB service.
Create a new database and collections for storing blog posts and categories.
Define the schema for the blog post document, including fields such as title, content, author, tags, and creation date.
Implement functionality to insert sample blog posts into the database.

## Implementing CRUD Operations
Create API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.
Implement routes to retrieve blog posts based on different criteria, such as author, tags, or date range.
Allow users to update and delete their own blog posts.
Implement endpoints for creating and managing blog post categories.

## Aggregations
Utilize MongoDB's aggregation framework to perform operations like grouping, sorting, and filtering on the blog posts.
Implement functionality to retrieve the most recent blog posts, most viewed posts, or posts with the highest engagement.
Create an API endpoint to retrieve aggregated data based on user-specified criteria.
