# M6A1 - ExpressJs with relational DB

## Assignment
You are tasked with building a Book Store Purchase Flow using Express.js, MySQL, and TypeORM. The application should allow users to browse books, add them to a shopping cart, place orders, and view their order history. 

## Tasks
Setting up the Database:
- Connect Node.js with a MySQL database using the appropriate driver.
- Create a MySQL database schema for the book store application.
- Define tables for books, users, shopping carts, cart items, orders, and order items with appropriate relationships and fields.

Implementing CRUD Operations:
- Create RESTful API endpoints for managing books, users, shopping carts, and orders.
- Implement routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting book records.
- Create endpoints for adding and removing books from the shopping cart.
- Implement routes for placing orders and retrieving order history for a user.


Introduction to ORM and TypeORM:
- Connect to the MySQL database using TypeORM.
- Define entities for books, users, shopping carts, orders, and order items using decorators provided by TypeORM.
- Use TypeORM's query builder to execute database queries instead of writing raw SQL.

Querying and Manipulating Data with TypeORM:
- Implement functions to query books based on criteria such as author, title, or genre using TypeORM's query builder.
- Use TypeORM's repository methods to create, update, and delete records in the database.
- Implement relationships between entities  as defined in the database in the previous assignment
